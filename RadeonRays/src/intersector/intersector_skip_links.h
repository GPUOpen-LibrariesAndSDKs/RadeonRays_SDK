    \version 1.0
    \brief Intersector implementation based on BVH with skip links.

    IntersectorSkipLinks implementation is based on the following paper:
    "Efficiency Issues for Ray Tracing" Brian Smits
    http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2016/course/course/TDA361/EfficiencyIssuesForRayTracing.pdf

    Intersector is using binary BVH with a single bounding box per node. BVH layout guarantees
    that left child of an internal node lies right next to it in memory. Each BVH node has a 
    skip link to the node traversed next. The traversal pseude code is

        while(addr is valid)
        {
            node <- fetch next node at addr
            if (rays intersects with node bbox)
            {
                if (node is leaf)
                    intersect leaf
                else
                {
                    addr <- addr + 1 (follow left child)
                    continue
                }
            }

            addr <- skiplink at node (follow next)
        }

    Pros:
        -Simple and efficient kernel with low VGPR pressure.
        -Can traverse trees of arbitrary depth.
    Cons:
        -Travesal order is fixed, so poor algorithmic characteristics.
        -Does not benefit from BVH quality optimizations.
