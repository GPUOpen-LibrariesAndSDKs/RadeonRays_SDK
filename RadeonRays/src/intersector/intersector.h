    Intersector encapsulate the logic of finding batched ray intersection and occlusion queries for a given world.
    Before calling any of QueryXXX methods, the user should call Intersector::Preprocess(world). This methods might
    take significant time to finish since it includes acceleration structure builds, etc. Not all worlds are compatible
    with all intersectors. Before calling Preprocess() the user must make sure the world is compatible using 
    IsCompatible() method.
